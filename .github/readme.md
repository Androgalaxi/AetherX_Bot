## 🚀 Installation
Follow these steps to invite AetherX to your server:

1. **Invite the bot**:
   ```bash
   Invite: https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1067646246254284840

   You have two options while installing the bot.
   1. Adding it to a server
   2. Adding it as an app

   **Info**:
   When you invite the bot, we chose to give it admin permission at the current time to avoid any issues as we keep adding things. This is to avoid any issues while also testing.

   When you add AetherX as an App, you can use supported slash commands almost anywhere. We're still working on bringing more slash commands to life.
